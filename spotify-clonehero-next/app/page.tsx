# Overall Intro
This site primarily provides a collection of tools to help
you find charts to songs you know but might not find in
Chorus's 10s of thousands of charts.

The tools on this website don't require any downloads or custom
applications on your computer. Manage your Songs directory directly
from your browser!

Note: This website will not work on your browser. It requires some APIs that
currently only exist in Chrome based browsers.

# Tools:
## Updates
Check Chorus for newer/better charts than you have installed.
Looks for newer charts that charter has published, and higher quality charts (more instruments, difficulties, and more)

## Spotify Library
Find charts on Chorus that match songs you have saved in your Spotify playlists

## Spotify History (advanced!)
If you've downloaded your Complete Listening History from your Spotify Account settings,
this will find charts to songs you've ever listened to.

## Chart Error Checker
Primarily for charters. Check your charts for quality issues that will get flagged
by the Chorus bot before submitting.
